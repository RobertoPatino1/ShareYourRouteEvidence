# Share Your Route

This repository contains the resources used in the creation of the software requirements specification for the first project of the subject Software Engineering 1.
This resources include both the high and low fidelity prototypes for the app, evidences of the testing fase with the low fidelity prototype and other diagrams used in the elaboration of this project.


## Project Description
"Share Your Route" is an application that emerges as a solution that helps to optimize, enrich,
and strengthen the travel experience provided by tourism companies.
The system will provide businesses with the right tools and features to ensure safety and effective
communication for both guides and tourists. The company will be able to publish different tour
packages and offer them to tourists in a personalized way based on each user’s previous travel
experiences.
